# Self-Hosting API Analytics

API Analytics can be easily self-hosted, allowing for full control over your stored logged request data.

Requirements:

- a publically addressable environment that can run Docker Compose, such as a VPS; and
- a domain name that is pointing to your server's IP address.

By default, the `docker-compose.yml` file is set up to generate a free SSL certificate for your domain using Certbot and Let's Encrypt.

You may need to adjust this configuration to work with your environment.

**Self-hosting is still undergoing testing, development and further improvements to make it as easy as possible to deploy. It is currently recommended that you avoid self-hosting for production use.**

## Backend Hosting

### Getting Started

#### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone github.com/tom-draper/api-analytics
```

Open the `self-hosting` directory.

```bash
cd api-analytics/server/self-hosting
```

#### 2. Edit the `.env` file

Enter:
- your `DOMAIN_NAME` e.g. example.com 
- a `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` for the database

#### 3. Obtain an SSL certificate using Certbot

Start the `certbot` and `nginx` services.

```bash
docker compose up certbot nginx -d
```

Generate the SSL certificate, replacing `your-domain.com` with your actual domain and `your-email@example.com` with your email address.

```bash
docker exec -it certbot certbot certonly --webroot -w /var/www/certbot -d your-domain.com -d www.your-domain.com --agree-tos --email your-email@example.com --no-eff-email
```

Stop the services once complete.

```bash
docker compose down
```

Replace the temporary `nginx-certbot.conf.template` with the fully SSL-compatible `nginx.conf.template` in the `docker-compose.yaml` file under the `nginx` configuration. Comment out the appropriate lines to match the following:

```yaml
# - ./nginx/nginx-certbot.conf.template:/etc/nginx/conf.d/nginx.conf.template
- ./nginx/nginx.conf.template:/etc/nginx/conf.d/nginx.conf.template
```

#### 4. Start the services

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

### Testing

#### Internal

Check if all six docker services are running.

```bash
docker ps
```

Quickly check if services are working by attempting to generate a new API key.

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/generate
```

Confirm services are working internally by running the `tests/test-internal.sh` bash script.

```bash
chmod +x tests/test-internal.sh
./tests/test-internal.sh
```

#### Nginx

Confirm Nginx is running and able to direct to the internal services.

```bash
curl -kL -X GET http://localhost/api/generate
```

```bash
curl -k -X GET https://localhost/api/generate
```

Confirm the Nginx service is working internally by running the `tests/test-nginx.sh` and  `tests/test-nginx.sl` bash scripts.

```bash
chmod +x tests/test-nginx.sh
./tests/test-nginx.sh

chmod +x tests/test-nginx-ssl.sh
./tests/test-nginx-ssl.sh
```

#### External

Outside of the hosting environment, confirm that services are publically accessible with an API key generation attempt.

```bash
curl -X GET http://<ip-address>:3000/api/generate
```

Confirm your domain is set up and that Nginx is working correctly.

```bash
curl -X GET https://your-domain.com/api/generate
```

Confirm the services are working externally by running the `tests/test-external.sh` bash script, providing your domain name.

```bash
chmod +x tests/test-external.sh
./tests/test-external.sh your-domain.com
```

Finally, confirm the dashboard can communicate with your server by attempting to generate an API key at: `https://www.apianalytics.dev/generate?source=https://your-domain.com`

You can check:
- Nginx logs with `docker logs nginx`
- API logs with `docker exec -it api tail api.log`

#### Maintenance

Check the status of the running services with:

```bash
docker ps
```

If needed, you can stop all services with:

```bash
docker compose stop
```

Remove all containers and images with:

```bash
docker compose down --rmi all
```

##### Database

The `database/schema.sql` schema is used to initialise the postgres database once the container is first built.

You can run custom SQL commands with:

```bash
docker exec -it db psql -U postgres -d analytics -c "YOUR SQL COMMAND;"
```

##### Updates

Updating the backend with the latest improvements is straight-forward, but will come with some downtime.

```bash
docker compose down
git pull origin main
docker compose up -d
```

##### Locations

Optional IP-to-location mappings are provided by the GeoLite2 Country database maintained by MaxMind. Create a free account at `https://www.maxmind.com/en/home`, and download and copy the `GeoLite2-Country.mmdb` file into the `server/logger` folder.

### Usage

#### Logging Requests

Once your backend services are running and tested, you can log requests to your server by specifying the server URL within the API Analytics middleware config.

```py
import uvicorn
from api_analytics.fastapi import Analytics, Config
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()
config = Config(server_url='https://your-domain.com')
app.add_middleware(Analytics, api_key=<api-key>, config=config)

@app.get("/")
async def root():
    return {"message": "Hello World!"}

if __name__ == "__main__":
    uvicorn.run("app:app", reload=True)
```

You can confirm requests are being logged by checking the logs.

```bash
docker logs nginx
docker exec -it logger tail requests.log
```

#### Dashboard

You can use the dashboard by specifying the URL of your server as a `source` parameter when using `apianalytics.dev`, or you can access the raw data directly by making a GET request to your API data endpoint.

You can access your dashboard at: `https://www.apianalytics.dev/dashboard?source=https://www.your-domain.com`

You can access your raw data by sending a GET request to `https://www.your-domain.com/api/data`, with your API key set as `X-AUTH-TOKEN` in the headers.

## Frontend Hosting

Once up and running, self-hosted backend can be fully utilised and managed through `apianalytics.dev`. This ensures you always have the latest updates and improvements to the dashboard.

Alternatively, it's possible to self-host the frontend dashboard by setting the URL of your backend service as a `SERVER_URL` environment variable, or manually changing the `SERVER_URL` held in `src/lib/consts.ts`. The frontend can then be deployed using your preferred hosting provider.

## Contributions

Feel free to customise this project to your preference. Any feedback or improvements that can still generalise to most deployment environments is much appreciated.
